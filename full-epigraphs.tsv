All men pursue good, and would be happy, if they knew how. A steady, durable good, cannot be derived from an external cause, by reason all derived from externals must fluctuate, as they fluctutate. What then remains but the cause internal; the very cause which we have supposed when we place the sovereign good in mind - in rectitude of conduct?']		['Virtue our highest interest']		['James Harris']	['Harris']
