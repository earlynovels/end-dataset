The adventures of Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, king of Ithaca, &c. in Greece, and one of the princes who conducted the siege of Troy. Complete in twenty-four books. Originally written in French, not only for the use and instruction of the dauphin of France, to guard him, in an allegorical way, against forming his conduct after the bad example of his grandfather Louis XIV, but also to promote the happiness of mankind in general; by Francis Salignac de la Motte Fenelon, late archbishop of Cambray, in the French Netherlands. Now newly translated from the best Paris and other editions, by William Henry Melmoth, esq. Author of the new abridgment of the Roman history-of the complete abridgment of the Grecian history-and of the new universal story-teller, or modern picture of human life; being an approved collection of original and select pieces in prose and verse.-Price 3s. each bound. To which are added, the life of the original author; the heads and arguments of each book at large; and a great variety of notes, historical, critical, explanatory, scholastic, political, moral, philological, satirical, and illustrative: comprehending the most salutary reflections and remarks, with allusions to ancient mythology, geography, and universal history, particularly to the histories of England and France:-A work of the first reputation, replete with maxims of human prudence, and including the most perfect system of morality ever presented to the world, displaying to all descriptions of persons the horrors of vice, and the charms of virtue, in the most forcible manner. The mysteries of the wisest and best politics are here developed: the inordinate passions are depicted as a yoke equally disgraceful and fatal; while the moral duties appear with all the attractions of ease and beauty. The reasoning is just, the precepts are important. It is a work which genius and learning have dedicated to virtue; it at once captivates the imagination, informs the understanding, and regulates the will. This valuable book teaches us to make morality and religion our guide in good, as well as in adverse fortune; never to forget the love we owe our parents and our country. It forms our minds for a king, a citizen, a father, a mother, a master, a gentleman, a tradesman, a servant, and even a slave, if such should be our lot; and, in short, teaches us to act properly in all the various spheres of life. Mentor (under which character is meant Minerva) in his counsels to Telemachus, must make us just, humane, patient, sincere, discreet, and modest. He never speaks but he pleases, engages, moves, and persuades. We cannot attend to him but with admiration; and, in proportion as we admire, we cannot help loving his advice, which is entertaining as well as instructive. This translation has been carefully revised with all the former editions, and particular attention has been paid to the various readings of Hawkesworth, Smollett, Boyer, Litterbury, Oldes, Ozell, and others, entirely omitting their inaccuracies and blemishes, and preserving whatever we judged might elucidate the great design the author had in view when he composed this work, viz. of promoting the happiness of his noble pupil in particular, and of the world in general. Embellished in a very superior stile of magnificence, with a set of unusually grand copper-plates, exquisitely designed by those ingenious artists, Kauffman, Monnet, Eisen, and Moreau, and engraved, in a capital manner, by Messrs. Walker, Collyer Grignion, Bartolozzi, and Grainger, who have exerted their unrivalled talents in these splendid performances; single impression of which will be charged at 2s. each print: so that these capital engravings alone will be absolutely worth four times the price of the whole work; which is the most beautiful edition of Telemachus ever published in this or any other country, and calculated to gratify every class of readers.			1		1770		London		London: printed only for Alex.

"Nearly completely transcription, in which the author quotes a defense of the romantic novel first published in New Monthly Magazine: """"With regard to the morality of writing or reading works of imagination, the author has been also under some doubts; but as the principle of philanthropy must commence its expanding influence in the heart, by breaking up the disposition which contracts all its interest upon self, and as these characters are inaccissble to moral lectures, and to the claims of real and passing events, if ever they come to know the happiness of being carried beyond the range of emotion within themselves, and elevated to a perception of grandeur and beauty, which, there, they must forever have remained strangers to, ti must be by being taken at unawares by romantic pictures of fictious suffering, of ideal beauty, and disinterested heroism; very inferior, indeed, to that sympahty which inspires real self-sacrifice, but better far than wholly to be ignorant of the joy of natural tears.. \'If novels (says a writer in the New Monthly Magainze, to whom I am indebted for some of the preceeding ideas) are not the deepest teachers of humanity, they have, at least, the widest range. They lend to genius \'lighter wings to fly.\' They are read where Milton and Shakspeare are only talked of, and even where their names are never heard. They nestle gently beneath the covers of unconscious sofas; are read by fair and glistening eyes, in moments snatched from repose; and beneath counters and shopboards, minister delights, secret, sweet and precious. It is possible that in particular instances their effects may be baneful; but, on the whole, we are persuaded they are good. The world is not in danger of becoming too romantic. The golden threads of poesy are not too thickly or too closely interwoven with the ordinary web of existence. Sympathy is the first great lesson which man should learn. It will be ill for him if he proceed no farther; if his emotions are but excited to roll back on his heart, and to be fostered in luxurious quite. But unless he learns to feel tenderly and deeply for things in which he has no personal interest, he can achieve nothing generous or noble. This lesson is in reality of all excellent. How mistaken are those miserable reasoners who object to them as giving false pictures of life—of purity too glossy and etherial—of friendship too deep and confiding—of love which does not shrink at the approach of ill, but ‘looks on tempests and is never shaken,’ because with these the world too rarely blossoms! Were these things visionary and unreal, who would break the spell, and bid the delicious enchantment vanish? The soul will not be the worse for believing that the highest excellence is within the reach of its exertions but these things are not unreal; they are shadows indeed, in themselves, but they are shadows cast from objects stately, grand and eternal. Man can never imagine that which has no foundation in his nature.\' The above quotation is made, not because it applies in this particular place, in a preface to a work which scarcely makes a feeble effort to soar above the most ordinary probabilities, and the ruggedness of which is unsmoothed by either distance of time or place; but because this book, if read at at all, will be read by those who have not been in the habit of indulging their intellectual appetite with such kind of stimuli."""						true		 | Byron	Third-person	Letters		true								Tale	Adsonville	Library Company

Now all this is extremely tantalising.

And should the creditor support on of the best of characters, be deservedly esteem\'d by all who know him as a most worthy, benevolent, and friendly man, one of strict honour himself, and from thence naturally averse to any doubts concerning others, would not those be doubly culpable who left him to the disagreeable alternative of either fitting down with the loss to himself and family, or commencing a suit that be might be more painful to a man of good disposition? Suppose also, that previous notice had been given to the gentleman of his wife\'s design, could she, after having waited many weeks to give him time for his deliberation, be justly blamed for carrying that design into execution?

As to young ladies, they are out of the question; no chaste virgin ever read a romance: but if perchance any young young girl should dare to read a single page of this, she is inevitably lost. Yet let her not accuse me as the cause of her perdition: the mischief was done before; and since she is begun let her proceed, for she has nothing worse to fear."" | Preface, Rousseau addresses fiction verus reality: """"Though I appear only as the editor of this work, I confess that I have had some share in the composition.

Marginalia includes newspaper clippings about Scott, and Scott\'s name in pencil on the full title page. | Each chapter heading is preceded by an ornamental double-line of some sort (made up of leaves, patterns, or simply unadorned), and each chapter concludes with a small rectangular ornament, such as a crest."	The publisher of this description is under some difficulties, on the account of the author\'s addressing the volume to him, and making him a compliment in the beginning; which, as he conscious he does not deserve, he hopes the readers will impute to its proper cause, namely, to the warmth of friendship, which is too apt to exalt the object it esteems.

What then ought not the editor of this work to fear, in presenting to the public the letters of a young Peruvian, whose stile and thoughts so little agree with the mean idea which an unjust prejudice has caused us to form of her nation? Enriched by the precious spoils of Peru, we ought, at least, to regard the inhabitants of that part of the world as a magnificent people; and the sentiment of respect is not very remote from the idea of magnificence. But so prejudiced are we always in our own favour, that we rate the merit of other nations not only in proportion as their manners imitate ours, but in proportion as their tongues approach nearer to our Idiom. How can one be a Persian? We despite the Indians, and hardly grant a thinking soul to those unhappy people: yet their history is in every one\'s hands, and abounds with monuments of the sagacity of their minds, and the solidity of their philosophy. The apologist of humanity and of beautiful nature has traced the out-lines of the Indian manners in a dramatic poem, the subject of which divides the glory with the execution.With so much light given us into the characters of these people, there should seem no room to fear that original letters which only exhibit what we already know of the lively and natural wit of the Indians, are in danger of passing for a fiction. But, that prejudice any eyes? There is no fecundity against its judgement, and we should have been careful not to submit this work to it, if its empire has been without bounds. It seems needless to give notice, that the first letters of Zilia were translated by herself: every one must easily judge, that, being composed in a language, and traced in a manner equally unknown to us, this collection could never have reached us, if the same hand had not writ them in our tongue. We owe this translation to Zilia\'s leisure in her retreat: her complaisance in communicating them to the chevalier Deterville, and the permission he at last obtained to keep them, were the means that conveyed them into our hands."""				true	"In reference to the question ""How can one be a Persian?"""
