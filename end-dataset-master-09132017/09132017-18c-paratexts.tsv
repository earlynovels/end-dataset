341331	The adventures of Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, king of Ithaca, &c. in Greece, and one of the princes who conducted the siege of Troy. Complete in twenty-four books. Originally written in French, not only for the use and instruction of the dauphin of France, to guard him, in an allegorical way, against forming his conduct after the bad example of his grandfather Louis XIV, but also to promote the happiness of mankind in general; by Francis Salignac de la Motte Fenelon, late archbishop of Cambray, in the French Netherlands. Now newly translated from the best Paris and other editions, by William Henry Melmoth, esq. Author of the new abridgment of the Roman history-of the complete abridgment of the Grecian history-and of the new universal story-teller, or modern picture of human life; being an approved collection of original and select pieces in prose and verse.-Price 3s. each bound. To which are added, the life of the original author; the heads and arguments of each book at large; and a great variety of notes, historical, critical, explanatory, scholastic, political, moral, philological, satirical, and illustrative: comprehending the most salutary reflections and remarks, with allusions to ancient mythology, geography, and universal history, particularly to the histories of England and France:-A work of the first reputation, replete with maxims of human prudence, and including the most perfect system of morality ever presented to the world, displaying to all descriptions of persons the horrors of vice, and the charms of virtue, in the most forcible manner. The mysteries of the wisest and best politics are here developed: the inordinate passions are depicted as a yoke equally disgraceful and fatal; while the moral duties appear with all the attractions of ease and beauty. The reasoning is just, the precepts are important. It is a work which genius and learning have dedicated to virtue; it at once captivates the imagination, informs the understanding, and regulates the will. This valuable book teaches us to make morality and religion our guide in good, as well as in adverse fortune; never to forget the love we owe our parents and our country. It forms our minds for a king, a citizen, a father, a mother, a master, a gentleman, a tradesman, a servant, and even a slave, if such should be our lot; and, in short, teaches us to act properly in all the various spheres of life. Mentor (under which character is meant Minerva) in his counsels to Telemachus, must make us just, humane, patient, sincere, discreet, and modest. He never speaks but he pleases, engages, moves, and persuades. We cannot attend to him but with admiration; and, in proportion as we admire, we cannot help loving his advice, which is entertaining as well as instructive. This translation has been carefully revised with all the former editions, and particular attention has been paid to the various readings of Hawkesworth, Smollett, Boyer, Litterbury, Oldes, Ozell, and others, entirely omitting their inaccuracies and blemishes, and preserving whatever we judged might elucidate the great design the author had in view when he composed this work, viz. of promoting the happiness of his noble pupil in particular, and of the world in general. Embellished in a very superior stile of magnificence, with a set of unusually grand copper-plates, exquisitely designed by those ingenious artists, Kauffman, Monnet, Eisen, and Moreau, and engraved, in a capital manner, by Messrs. Walker, Collyer Grignion, Bartolozzi, and Grainger, who have exerted their unrivalled talents in these splendid performances; single impression of which will be charged at 2s. each print: so that these capital engravings alone will be absolutely worth four times the price of the whole work; which is the most beautiful edition of Telemachus ever published in this or any other country, and calculated to gratify every class of readers.

The Defects of Stile, the ingenuous simplicity, and the tender Sentiments which animated Zilia, and alone dictated all that she wrote the first Year of her Misfortunes; all appeared to me of a Character too opposite to the Prejudices of our Nation, for me to think it would amuse the French. Reasons so plausible would have diverted me from this Enterprize, if I had entertained the same Fears with Regard to the Sequel which I now publish, but which was of Necessity preceded by that, which appeared to found the Taste of the Publick. The Reader, however, will see with a single Glance, how much Preference is due to this Sequel. In the first Part of these Letters Zilia had not yet changed any thing but her Dress; But he will find in this a greater Progress than he could have expected from an Indian Capacity. The Princess Royal of Cusco looks no longer for the Peruvian Virgin behind the Glass, and her Reason\'s too much enlightened to refuse her Arm to a Physician. Her stile is corrected with as much Care as she was capable of bestowing on it, and her civilized Pen knows how to throw a Lustre upon whatever her Imagination furnishes.
