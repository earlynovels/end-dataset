The habits, manners, and principles of the youth committed to their care, depend in no small degree upon their instructions and example, and the future usefulness of the scholar in society is closely connected with the ability and faithfulness of his early teacher....

The adventures of Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, king of Ithaca, &c. in Greece, and one of the princes who conducted the siege of Troy. Complete in twenty-four books. Originally written in French, not only for the use and instruction of the dauphin of France, to guard him, in an allegorical way, against forming his conduct after the bad example of his grandfather Louis XIV, but also to promote the happiness of mankind in general; by Francis Salignac de la Motte Fenelon, late archbishop of Cambray, in the French Netherlands. Now newly translated from the best Paris and other editions, by William Henry Melmoth, esq. Author of the new abridgment of the Roman history-of the complete abridgment of the Grecian history-and of the new universal story-teller, or modern picture of human life; being an approved collection of original and select pieces in prose and verse.-Price 3s. each bound. To which are added, the life of the original author; the heads and arguments of each book at large; and a great variety of notes, historical, critical, explanatory, scholastic, political, moral, philological, satirical, and illustrative: comprehending the most salutary reflections and remarks, with allusions to ancient mythology, geography, and universal history, particularly to the histories of England and France:-A work of the first reputation, replete with maxims of human prudence, and including the most perfect system of morality ever presented to the world, displaying to all descriptions of persons the horrors of vice, and the charms of virtue, in the most forcible manner. The mysteries of the wisest and best politics are here developed: the inordinate passions are depicted as a yoke equally disgraceful and fatal; while the moral duties appear with all the attractions of ease and beauty. The reasoning is just, the precepts are important. It is a work which genius and learning have dedicated to virtue; it at once captivates the imagination, informs the understanding, and regulates the will. This valuable book teaches us to make morality and religion our guide in good, as well as in adverse fortune; never to forget the love we owe our parents and our country. It forms our minds for a king, a citizen, a father, a mother, a master, a gentleman, a tradesman, a servant, and even a slave, if such should be our lot; and, in short, teaches us to act properly in all the various spheres of life. Mentor (under which character is meant Minerva) in his counsels to Telemachus, must make us just, humane, patient, sincere, discreet, and modest. He never speaks but he pleases, engages, moves, and persuades. We cannot attend to him but with admiration; and, in proportion as we admire, we cannot help loving his advice, which is entertaining as well as instructive. This translation has been carefully revised with all the former editions, and particular attention has been paid to the various readings of Hawkesworth, Smollett, Boyer, Litterbury, Oldes, Ozell, and others, entirely omitting their inaccuracies and blemishes, and preserving whatever we judged might elucidate the great design the author had in view when he composed this work, viz. of promoting the happiness of his noble pupil in particular, and of the world in general. Embellished in a very superior stile of magnificence, with a set of unusually grand copper-plates, exquisitely designed by those ingenious artists, Kauffman, Monnet, Eisen, and Moreau, and engraved, in a capital manner, by Messrs. Walker, Collyer Grignion, Bartolozzi, and Grainger, who have exerted their unrivalled talents in these splendid performances; single impression of which will be charged at 2s. each print: so that these capital engravings alone will be absolutely worth four times the price of the whole work; which is the most beautiful edition of Telemachus ever published in this or any other country, and calculated to gratify every class of readers.			1			1770		London		London: printed only for Alex.

Every thing, that he undertakes has somewhat of the marvellous belonging to it [Here, suggests that readers can identify what is ""marvellous"" or what we might now call fictional--a bit larger than life, yet believably real--but do not fully recognize the work as fiction because of prefatory legitimacy claims]. In this Rome opens her bosom to him, and discovers all her treasures; in his Paysanne Parvenue* [Footnote: *A celebrate Novel of the same Author's, that has been miserably murder'd, under the Title of the Fortunate Country Maid.], a Marchioness of the first rank, intrusts him with her secrets; and in his Mentor a-la-Mode, he entertains us with analogies, which have never been though on by any body but himself: And, the first opportunity, he will palm upon us, with the same confidence, some new flights of his imagination, and will give us to understand, that they are to have the greater regard paid to them, on account of some such mystery miraculously brought to light. Such are the censures I must expect from them [who is ""them""? readers? critics?]: What, then, must I do in this cafe? I cannot compel them to believe me; nothing is more free than thought; and were I in their stead, perhaps, I should say more. The publick are to be our judge; and, to pass sentence on all the works of nature: Were I desirous of pre-possessing them in my favour, I would here make an encomium upon their equity; but what would this avail me? I should acquaint them with nothing new, and they would not be a jot the less severe in their criticisms. As for falling upon my knees and asking their pardon, in a preface, as a learned man* [Footnote: *Monsieur Boileau.] says upon this head, I am their very humble servant; and renounce their favour, at this mortifying price. But let us leave vain reflections; frequently arising from the pleasure of talking of one's self; which is a vanity common to almost all authors: let us endeavour not to imitate them, and return to our subject.""

Imitation is natural to the human mind. [...] In the selection of proper pieces to assist toward so pleasing a method of instruction [e.g. novel reading], no incosiderable part of the attention ought to be paid to the stile and language of the writers; for it is certain that those who can best express their sentiments, are those who conceive them best.

It begins with a short history of marriage communicated to the publisher by ""a country gentleman of plain, solid abilities."" The history is noteworthy for its Protestant anti-Catholicism, including a fascinating take on the Reformation: the gentleman ""had traced back into the early ages of Christianity, where he found Matrimony treated as a sacrament of the utmost consequence to mankind; but observed, that the priesthood who strongly recommended it to others, had absolutely refused the blessing themselves.--But the disturbing conduct of those pious rakes soon brought about a religious reformation, where reason and fitness taking place, the clergy were admonished to Marriage, whose families, in general, soon became a numerous and useful ornament to the state, agreeable to the precepts of Christianity...."" The preface is concluded by observations on the conditions (prudence and love) necessary for a happy marriage."			First sentence reads: The authoress has presumed to appeal, soliciting their regard to the following sheets, which are laid before them from a motive of supporting with esteem, and regaining to matrimony its original liberty, clearing it from the disgrace of polite, fashionable, and avaricious pollutions, with which it has (not from consent, but violence) has stained; and the oppressive formalities, shackles and chains, that a partial legislature had impolitically loaded it with; restoring it to its antient primitive companions, prudence, affection, and love, which only can render it useful to a state, a blessing to individuals, and worthy a public care.

First sentence reads: Nature, and the memory of strange deeds of renown, have flung over the valley of Mexico a charm more romantic than is attached to many of the vales of the olden world ; for though historic association and the spell of poetry have consecrated the borders of Leman and the laurel groves of Tempe, and Providence has touched both with the finger of beauty, yet does our fancy, in either, dwell upon objects which are not so much the adjuvants of romance as of sentiment ; in both, we gather food rather for feeling than imagination,--we live over thoughts which are generated by memory, and our conceptions are the reproductions of experience....This is the proper field for romantic musings.		true		['', 'Garcilaso de la Vega.']	['Third-person']					Author (text)	Proper name	Male	Male		['The infidel']	['Knight', 'Conquest', 'Romance', 'Author', 'Edition', 'Volume']	['Mexico']	University of Pennsylvania	CP	Swarthmore College

Johnson, printer.	['Johnson, J. C.']			Duodecimo		['Signatures: [pi]♯ 1-23¡ 24¿ [by Library Company cataloger]']	Nearly completely transcription, in which the author quotes a defense of the romantic novel first published in New Monthly Magazine: ""With regard to the morality of writing or reading works of imagination, the author has been also under some doubts; but as the principle of philanthropy must commence its expanding influence in the heart, by breaking up the disposition which contracts all its interest upon self, and as these characters are inaccissble to moral lectures, and to the claims of real and passing events, if ever they come to know the happiness of being carried beyond the range of emotion within themselves, and elevated to a perception of grandeur and beauty, which, there, they must forever have remained strangers to, ti must be by being taken at unawares by romantic pictures of fictious suffering, of ideal beauty, and disinterested heroism; very inferior, indeed, to that sympahty which inspires real self-sacrifice, but better far than wholly to be ignorant of the joy of natural tears.. 'If novels (says a writer in the New Monthly Magainze, to whom I am indebted for some of the preceeding ideas) are not the deepest teachers of humanity, they have, at least, the widest range. They lend to genius 'lighter wings to fly.' They are read where Milton and Shakspeare are only talked of, and even where their names are never heard. They nestle gently beneath the covers of unconscious sofas; are read by fair and glistening eyes, in moments snatched from repose; and beneath counters and shopboards, minister delights, secret, sweet and precious. It is possible that in particular instances their effects may be baneful; but, on the whole, we are persuaded they are good. The world is not in danger of becoming too romantic. The golden threads of poesy are not too thickly or too closely interwoven with the ordinary web of existence. Sympathy is the first great lesson which man should learn. It will be ill for him if he proceed no farther; if his emotions are but excited to roll back on his heart, and to be fostered in luxurious quite. But unless he learns to feel tenderly and deeply for things in which he has no personal interest, he can achieve nothing generous or noble. This lesson is in reality of all excellent. How mistaken are those miserable reasoners who object to them as giving false pictures of life—of purity too glossy and etherial—of friendship too deep and confiding—of love which does not shrink at the approach of ill, but ‘looks on tempests and is never shaken,’ because with these the world too rarely blossoms! Were these things visionary and unreal, who would break the spell, and bid the delicious enchantment vanish? The soul will not be the worse for believing that the highest excellence is within the reach of its exertions but these things are not unreal; they are shadows indeed, in themselves, but they are shadows cast from objects stately, grand and eternal. Man can never imagine that which has no foundation in his nature.' The above quotation is made, not because it applies in this particular place, in a preface to a work which scarcely makes a feeble effort to soar above the most ordinary probabilities, and the ruggedness of which is unsmoothed by either distance of time or place; but because this book, if read at at all, will be read by those who have not been in the habit of indulging their intellectual appetite with such kind of stimuli."						true		['', 'Byron']	['Third-person']	['Letters']		true								['Tale']	['Adsonville']	Library Company	Rare Am 1824 Hull 69926.D	1

A number of the tales in this volume have already been published, but some of them appeared several years ago, and are now forgotten: and while a few have had the advantage of extensive circulation in popular periodicals, others have not been thus favoured.

Now""--explicit interparatextuality--""I protest I never met with any adventure of the kind. I should not have grieved at this, had it not been intimated by the author of Waverly [Sir Walter Scott], in an introduction to his novel of Peveril of the Peak, that he was himself the stout gentleman alluded to. I have ever since been importuned by questions and letters from gentlemen, and particularly from ladies without number, touching what I had seen of the Great Unknown. Now all this is extremely tantalising. It is like being congratulated on the high prize when one has drawn a blank; for I have just as great a desire as any one of the public to penetrate the mystery of that very singular personage, whose voice fills every corner of the world, without any one being able to tell from whence it comes.""

The pictures are not overdrawn nor improbable, since each arrival from Europe brings us real pictures that bear the stamp of ficiton rather than truth, so peculiar and startling are they in their details. Love, that all powerful agent, is the grand mover of the panorama we present in these pages, and the reader will have occasion to acknowledge how potent and supreme is his sway over all.

Every thing, that he undertakes has somewhat of the marvellous belonging to it [Here, suggests that readers can identify what is ""marvellous"" or what we might now call fictional--a bit larger than life, yet believably real--but do not fully recognize the work as fiction because of prefatory legitimacy claims]. In this Rome opens her bosom to him, and discovers all her treasures; in his Paysanne Parvenue* [Footnote: *A celebrate Novel of the same Author's, that has been miserably murder'd, under the Title of the Fortunate Country Maid.], a Marchioness of the first rank, intrusts him with her secrets; and in his Mentor a-la-Mode, he entertains us with analogies, which have never been though on by any body but himself: And, the first opportunity, he will palm upon us, with the same confidence, some new flights of his imagination, and will give us to understand, that they are to have the greater regard paid to them, on account of some such mystery miraculously brought to light. Such are the censures I must expect from them [who is ""them""? readers? critics?]: What, then, must I do in this cafe? I cannot compel them to believe me; nothing is more free than thought; and were I in their stead, perhaps, I should say more. The publick are to be our judge; and, to pass sentence on all the works of nature: Were I desirous of pre-possessing them in my favour, I would here make an encomium upon their equity; but what would this avail me? I should acquaint them with nothing new, and they would not be a jot the less severe in their criticisms. As for falling upon my knees and asking their pardon, in a preface, as a learned man* [Footnote: *Monsieur Boileau.] says upon this head, I am their very humble servant; and renounce their favour, at this mortifying price.

Reads: "Sir, Your defcent from the moft illuftrious Princes of Great Britain and Germany, and the high dignitiy of your title, which is truly paftoral, will, it is humbly hoped, in fome meafure justify the propriety, and apologize for the prefumption of dedicating This Discourse on the Origin and Use of Pastoral Poetry, and this Translation of Daphnis from the German into the English Language, to your Royal Highnefs.

The celebrated Mr. Gessner has truly and juftly obferved, that poetry has always been in the retinue of religion, and has greatly promoted her facred caufe; that it is a avery powerful and delightful method of teaching the leffons of morality; that it improves and refines the underftanding, and excites mankind to every laudable, worthy, and noble action. Small, therefore, as this poetical volume may appear to be, yet as it is of a moral tendency, there is fome pleafing encouragement to hope that it may not be altogether unacceptable to your Royal Highnefs.

What then ought not the editor of this work to fear, in presenting to the public the letters of a young Peruvian, whose stile and thoughts so little agree with the mean idea which an unjust prejudice has caused us to form of her nation? Enriched by the precious spoils of Peru, we ought, at least, to regard the inhabitants of that part of the world as a magnificent people; and the sentiment of respect is not very remote from the idea of magnificence. But so prejudiced are we always in our own favour, that we rate the merit of other nations not only in proportion as their manners imitate ours, but in proportion as their tongues approach nearer to our Idiom. How can one be a Persian? We despite the Indians, and hardly grant a thinking soul to those unhappy people: yet their history is in every one's hands, and abounds with monuments of the sagacity of their minds, and the solidity of their philosophy. The apologist of humanity and of beautiful nature has traced the out-lines of the Indian manners in a dramatic poem, the subject of which divides the glory with the execution.With so much light given us into the characters of these people, there should seem no room to fear that original letters which only exhibit what we already know of the lively and natural wit of the Indians, are in danger of passing for a fiction. But, that prejudice any eyes? There is no fecundity against its judgement, and we should have been careful not to submit this work to it, if its empire has been without bounds. It seems needless to give notice, that the first letters of Zilia were translated by herself: every one must easily judge, that, being composed in a language, and traced in a manner equally unknown to us, this collection could never have reached us, if the same hand had not writ them in our tongue. We owe this translation to Zilia's leisure in her retreat: her complaisance in communicating them to the chevalier Deterville, and the permission he at last obtained to keep them, were the means that conveyed them into our hands."				true	In reference to the question "How can one be a Persian?"
