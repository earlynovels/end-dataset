C.']			Duodecimo		['Signatures: [pi]♯ 1-23¡ 24¿ [by Library Company cataloger]']	Nearly completely transcription, in which the author quotes a defense of the romantic novel first published in New Monthly Magazine: ""With regard to the morality of writing or reading works of imagination, the author has been also under some doubts; but as the principle of philanthropy must commence its expanding influence in the heart, by breaking up the disposition which contracts all its interest upon self, and as these characters are inaccissble to moral lectures, and to the claims of real and passing events, if ever they come to know the happiness of being carried beyond the range of emotion within themselves, and elevated to a perception of grandeur and beauty, which, there, they must forever have remained strangers to, ti must be by being taken at unawares by romantic pictures of fictious suffering, of ideal beauty, and disinterested heroism; very inferior, indeed, to that sympahty which inspires real self-sacrifice, but better far than wholly to be ignorant of the joy of natural tears.. 'If novels (says a writer in the New Monthly Magainze, to whom I am indebted for some of the preceeding ideas) are not the deepest teachers of humanity, they have, at least, the widest range. They lend to genius 'lighter wings to fly.' They are read where Milton and Shakspeare are only talked of, and even where their names are never heard. They nestle gently beneath the covers of unconscious sofas; are read by fair and glistening eyes, in moments snatched from repose; and beneath counters and shopboards, minister delights, secret, sweet and precious. It is possible that in particular instances their effects may be baneful; but, on the whole, we are persuaded they are good. The world is not in danger of becoming too romantic. The golden threads of poesy are not too thickly or too closely interwoven with the ordinary web of existence. Sympathy is the first great lesson which man should learn. It will be ill for him if he proceed no farther; if his emotions are but excited to roll back on his heart, and to be fostered in luxurious quite. But unless he learns to feel tenderly and deeply for things in which he has no personal interest, he can achieve nothing generous or noble. This lesson is in reality of all excellent. How mistaken are those miserable reasoners who object to them as giving false pictures of life—of purity too glossy and etherial—of friendship too deep and confiding—of love which does not shrink at the approach of ill, but ‘looks on tempests and is never shaken,’ because with these the world too rarely blossoms! Were these things visionary and unreal, who would break the spell, and bid the delicious enchantment vanish? The soul will not be the worse for believing that the highest excellence is within the reach of its exertions but these things are not unreal; they are shadows indeed, in themselves, but they are shadows cast from objects stately, grand and eternal. Man can never imagine that which has no foundation in his nature.' The above quotation is made, not because it applies in this particular place, in a preface to a work which scarcely makes a feeble effort to soar above the most ordinary probabilities, and the ruggedness of which is unsmoothed by either distance of time or place; but because this book, if read at at all, will be read by those who have not been in the habit of indulging their intellectual appetite with such kind of stimuli."						true		['', 'Byron']	['Third-person']	['Letters']		true								['Tale']	['Adsonville']	Library Company	Rare Am 1824 Hull 69926.D	1

He is the more encouraged in this enterprise, by a belief that the American public is beginning to awaken from the apathy which which our native writers have heretofore been regarded, and that our countryment are now willing to bestow upon native genius, some of the patronage which has been lavished with indiscriminate profusion upon undeserving foreigners. A number of the tales in this volume have already been published, but some of them appeared several years ago, and are now forgotten: and while a few have had the advantage of extensive circulation in popular periodicals, others have not been thus favoured. It is thought therefore, that they will be sufficiently novel to most readers, and desirable to the friends of the author, to warrant the collection of them in a volume. It will be seen that they are strictly American. Should the work sustain in the opinion of the public, the character claimed for it, the published will have attained his object, and the author stand excused for permitting himself to be again placed at the bar of criticism as a writer of fiction.
